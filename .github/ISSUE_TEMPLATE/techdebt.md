# Tech Debt: [Title]

## Objective
A clear description of the technical debt being addressed and why fixing it improves long-term maintenance, performance, or developer experience.

---

## Context
How was this tech debt identified? (e.g., lint warnings, dependency audit, TypeScript strict-mode violations, performance profiles, or repeated manual workarounds)

---

## Scope & Refactoring Rules
- **Allowed modifications**: Exact directories or packages.
- **Strict Exclusions**: Rules to prevent scope creep. We MUST NOT rewrite unrelated systems.
- **Backward Compatibility**: API contracts and database schemas must be preserved unless explicitly planned.

---

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Refactored code reduces complexity or resolves issue [describe impact]
- [ ] No regression of existing functionality
- [ ] Test coverage maintained or improved

---

## Validation
- Complete execution of test suites: `pnpm test` (all workspaces)
- Build and lint validations: `pnpm build` and `pnpm lint`
