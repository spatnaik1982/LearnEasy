### Goal

Help learners build skills through structured success experiences.

---

# 3. ALX Design Principles

---

## ALX-1 Predictability

Every screen should feel familiar.

Users should always know:

* Where they are
* What they are doing
* What comes next
* How much remains

### Requirements

* Navigation remains fixed.
* Lesson structure never changes.
* Primary actions remain consistent.
* No unexpected interface changes.

---

## ALX-2 Visual First

Show before explaining.

### Requirements

Every concept begins with:

1. Visual Example
2. Demonstration
3. Explanation
4. Practice

### Rule

Images should carry the primary meaning.

Text should support visuals.

---

## ALX-3 One Concept at a Time

Never introduce multiple concepts simultaneously.

### Each Screen Should Contain

* One learning objective
* One task
* One decision

### Example

Good:

Count the apples.

Bad:

Count apples, compare quantities, and solve addition.

---

## ALX-4 Visible Progress

Progress must always be visible.

### Requirements

Display:

* Step indicators
* Question counts
* Lesson progress
* Completion state

### Example

Question 3 of 5

---

## ALX-5 Safe Mistakes

Mistakes are part of learning.

### Requirements

* Unlimited retries
* No penalties
* No public scoring
* No failure screens

### Preferred Language

"Let's try again."

### Avoid

"Incorrect."

"Failed."

---

## ALX-6 Controlled Sensory Environment

Learners control stimulation.

### Requirements

* No autoplay audio
* No autoplay video
* No flashing elements
* No unexpected animations

### User Controls

* Audio on/off
* Volume
* Motion reduction
* Contrast adjustment
* Audio speed

---

## ALX-7 Routine-Based Learning

Every lesson follows the same structure.

### Standard Lesson Flow

1. Learn
2. Practice
3. Quiz
4. Complete

Never change this sequence.

---

## ALX-8 Mastery-Based Progression

Progress reflects understanding.

### Focus On

* Mastery
* Growth
* Independence

### Avoid

* Competitive leaderboards
* Rankings
* Excessive point systems

---

# 4. TEACCH Structured Learning Architecture

---

## ALX-9 Structured Work Systems

Every learning screen must answer four questions.

### Question 1

What am I doing?

Example:

Count the apples.

---

### Question 2

How much work is there?

Example:

Question 2 of 5

---

### Question 3

How do I know I am finished?

Example:

Progress 40%

---

### Question 4

What happens next?

Example:

Next: Practice Activity

---

## Design Requirement

Every activity screen must visibly communicate all four answers.

---

# 5. Executive Function Support

---

## ALX-10 Executive Function Design

Many autistic learners experience difficulty with:

* Task initiation
* Planning
* Sequencing
* Transitions

The interface must compensate.

---

### Always Display

Current Task

Example:

Count Apples

---

Completion Status

Example:

3 of 5 Complete

---

Next Activity

Example:

Next: Quiz

---

### Resume Behavior

If a learner leaves:

* Return to the exact activity
* Preserve answers
* Preserve progress

Never restart automatically.

---

# 6. Transition Design

---

## ALX-11 Transition Preparation

Transitions must never be abrupt.

Before changing activities:

Show:

* Current activity completed
* Next activity
* Expected duration
* Start button

---

### Example

Great Work

Next: Practice

You will count objects independently.

[Start Practice]

---

### Avoid

Automatically launching the next activity.

---

# 7. ABA-Based Learning Design

---

## ALX-12 Prompt Hierarchy

Support should fade as mastery improves.

### Prompt Levels

Level 1

Full Demonstration

---

Level 2

Visual Hint

---

Level 3

Partial Hint

---

Level 4

Verbal Cue

---

Level 5

Independent

---

### Rule

Never remove support abruptly.

Always fade gradually.

---

## ALX-13 Errorless Learning

When introducing new concepts:

Success should be highly likely.

### Goal

Build confidence before introducing challenge.

---

## ALX-14 Shaping

Complex skills should be broken into smaller skills.

### Example

Addition

Count Objects

↓

Combine Groups

↓

Understand +

↓

Solve Addition Problems

---

## ALX-15 Reinforcement Framework

Reinforcement should support mastery.

### Preferred

* Positive feedback
* Progress visibility
* Mastery recognition

### Examples

Great work.

You counted correctly.

You completed the lesson.

---

### Avoid

* Slot-machine rewards
* Excessive badges
* Confetti explosions
* Dopamine-heavy gamification

---

# 8. Independence Tracking

---

## ALX-16 Independence Over Accuracy

The system should track:

* Accuracy
* Prompt Usage
* Retry Count
* Hint Usage
* Independence Score

---

### Example

Student A

90% accuracy

Required prompts every question

---

Student B

85% accuracy

Completed independently

---

Student B may demonstrate stronger learning progress.

---

# 9. Visual Schedule System

---

## Lesson Schedule

Display on every lesson.

---

### Rules

Always show:

* Current stage
* Next stage
* Remaining stages

Never hide lesson structure.

---

# 10. Learning Environment Zones

---

## ALX-17 Learning Zones

Each area should have a clear purpose.

---

### Learn Zone

Observe and understand concepts.

---

### Practice Zone

Guided learning.

---

### Quiz Zone

Independent mastery.

---

### Calm Zone

Regulation and breaks.

---

### Parent Zone

---

### Rule

Never mix multiple zones on one screen.

---

# 11. Calm Zone

---

## ALX-18 Self-Regulation Support

Every learner should have access to a safe break space.

Accessible globally.

---

### Contains

* Visual timer
* Deep breathing activity
* Calm visuals
* Favorite images
* Optional calming audio

---

### Rule

Using Calm Zone is never considered failure.

---

# 12. Personalization Framework

---

## Sensory Profile

Each learner maintains a sensory profile.

### Example

```typescript
interface SensoryProfile {
  audioSupport: boolean
  visualSupport: "low" | "medium" | "high"
  animationTolerance: "low" | "medium" | "high"
  readingDensity: "low" | "medium" | "high"
  promptLevel: "low" | "medium" | "high"
  attentionSpan: "short" | "medium" | "long"
}
```

---

Count the apples.

Choose the correct answer.

---

### Avoid

Let's conquer this challenge.

You're on fire.

---

## Sentence Length

Target:

5–12 words

---

## Feedback

Count one more time.

---

Avoid

Wrong.

Invalid.

---

# 19. AI Tutor Guidelines

---

## Communication Rules

AI must:

* Use short sentences
* Use literal language
* Explain one idea at a time
* Avoid sarcasm
* Avoid idioms
* Avoid abstract explanations

---

## Teaching Sequence

Always follow:

Show

↓

Explain

↓

Practice

---

## Orientation Rule

Before explanations, AI should establish:

* What the learner is doing
* What comes next

### Example

You are practicing addition.

After this question, you will do one more.

Let's count these apples.

---

## Praise Rules

Good

You counted correctly.

You completed the activity.

---

Avoid

You're a genius.

You're amazing.

---

# 20. Parent Experience Guidelines

Parents need clarity, not analytics overload.

The dashboard should answer:

* What was learned?
* What improved?
* What was difficult?
* What should be practiced next?

---

# 21. Success Indicators

The platform succeeds when learners can answer:

1. What am I doing?
2. What comes next?
3. How much is left?
4. How do I know I'm finished?

If a learner cannot answer these questions at any point, the design has failed the TEACCH model.

---

# 22. Design Review Checklist

Before release verify:

* Predictable layout
* One concept per screen
* Visible progress
* Structured work system present
* Executive function support present
* Transition preparation present
* Large touch targets
* Literal language
* Safe mistake handling
* Audio controls available
* Motion controls available
* Calm Zone accessible
* AI responses follow ALX rules
* Independence tracking implemented

Features that pass accessibility requirements but violate ALX principles should not be considered production-ready.

---

# ALX North Star

Create a learning environment that feels safe, predictable, visual, and achievable.

Use TEACCH to reduce anxiety and increase independence.

Use ABA to build mastery through small, achievable successes.

The learner should spend their energy learning concepts, not figuring out how the system works.
